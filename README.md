# Letter-Counter-MIPS

Done in MIPS Assembly Language.

Counts the letters in first 5000 characters of the the Tarzan story and outputs the top 5 used letters and the number of their occurances. 

The characters are listed in Hexadecimal code at the end of this program.

Almost every line is commented for clarity because this is Assembly code and not very human readable. 

If you want to run this program, you can download the [Mars MIPS simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/).

Please do not run Assembly code on your computer outside of the simulator!! This can be very dangerous!!
